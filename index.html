            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed
                 to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose
                programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA)
                ,[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
                without the need to recompile.
            </p>
            
            <p>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual
                 machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is
                similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

            <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
               emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
            </p> 
            
            <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
                paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and
                functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due
                to its comprehensive standard library.

            <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that
               is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of
               2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[12] often 
               incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
            engine to execute the code on users' devices.
            </p>
            
            <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the 
                ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and 
                imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for 
                working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document 
                Object Model (DOM)

            <p>C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/ SEE-PLUS-PLUS) is a general-purpose programming language created by 
                Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language,
                or "C with Classes".
            </p>
            
            <p>The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, 
                generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory 
                manipulation.

            multiple programming paradigms.

            <p>It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby,
